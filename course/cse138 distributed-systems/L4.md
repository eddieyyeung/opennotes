protocol: a set of rules that processes use to communicate with each other

correctness property of executions:

- FIFO delivery: if a process sends message $m_2$ after message $m_1$, any process delivering both delivers $m_1$ first.

**Sending** a message is something you do.

**Receiving** a message is something that happens to you.

**Delivering** a message is something you can do with a message you receive. (you can queue up received messages and wait to deliver them.)

FIFO delivery can be implemented with sequence numbers:

- messages get tagged with sender ID, and sender sequence number
- senders increment their sequence number after sending
- if a received message's SN is the SN of the prev mesaage from that sender + 1, deliver.

Using SNs for FIFO delivery only works well if you also have *reliable delivery* (TCP has both).
